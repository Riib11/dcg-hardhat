Designer Card Game.

Note that this is a very preliminary outline.

The idea is that the users design their own cards, which they can prove original
ownership of on the blockchain. Then players can create game invites to which
any player can join and compete for a prize.

## Usage

To setup:
```
npm install
```

To start a local node:
```shell
npm run node
```

To deploy the smart contract:
```shell
npm run deploy
```

And finally, to launch the webapp:
```shell
npm run start
```
